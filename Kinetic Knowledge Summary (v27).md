# Kinetic Knowledge Summary (v27)
*Reference for concepts and rationale — not executable.*

---

## 1. Essence
Kinetic = measurable, goal-aligned progress.  
Each [ ] task = one unit of intended action.  
Productivity = serving goals, not filling time.  
Scores: 1.000 = perfect; ~.750 = sustainable; <.5 = misaligned day.

---

## 2. Today System
One Card per day, ≤9 tasks ranked by impact.  
Points descend (n→1). Partial = ½ credit.  
Daily score = Actual ÷ Possible.  
Fewer tasks done well > many left undone.

---

## 3. S3 — Simplified Scheduling
Four zones by time horizon:  
**Today+**, **Next Few Days**, **This Week**, **Next Week+After**.  
Tasks move upward as priority rises; stale items drag focus.

---

## 4. Projects & Tags
Each `Project-[Name].md` tagged:  
#G = goal-aligned #NG = non-goal.  
Top card tasks usually from #G work.

---

## 5. Weekly Big Three
Three priorities chosen Fri 16:00 w/Greg.  
Live at top of S3.md; feed next week’s cards.  
Incomplete → carry or renegotiate; complete → mark [x], archive.

---

## 6. Reflection & Scorekeeping
**Daily:** log P, A, score (A÷P), short note.  
**Weekly:** compare avg, explain change, choose focus.  
Lifetime avg (ΣA÷ΣP) = long-term productivity gauge.

---

## 7. Archive
At month-end → `/Archive/YYYY-MM-Reflections.md`.  
Include date, tasks, points, notes.  
Keep 7 recent days in `/Cards/` active set.

---

## 8. Key Terms
**Card** – daily list & score tracker.  
**S3** – Simplified Scheduling System.  
**Big Three** – weekly main goals.  
**#G/#NG** – goal tags.  
**P/A** – possible / actual points.  
**Reflection** – insight log.  
**Scorekeeping.md** – running stats.  
**Archive** – historical record.

---

## 9. Principles
- Treat all `[ ]`/`[x]` as actionable tasks, anywhere.  
- Focus beats volume.  
- Gamify progress for feedback.  
- Write to think; review to improve.  
- Prioritize #G work.  
- Keep process light, visible, repeatable.

---

## 10. System Loop
1 Capture (S3) → 2 Focus (Card) → 3 Execute (Score) → 4 Reflect (Ref/Scorekeeping) → 5 Refine (Big Three).  
Cycle turns intention into sustained progress.
