## üöÄ Active Projects

### Roll out the Attachment A to our top customers
**Purpose:** To solidify explicit inventory coverage on items we're stocking by developing and sending the new *Attachment A* as a notification to our top X customers (to be identified) of their inventory commitments with Field.  
**Inclusion Rule:** Any open or new item containing ‚ÄúAttachment A‚Äù automatically falls under this project.  

**Phases:**
1. **Define Scope & Customer List**
   - [ ] Create Attachment A rollout tracker listing all target customers and planned send dates. *(Source list pulled from Power BI.)*
2. **Finalize and Refine Attachment A Content & Format**
   - [ ] Confirm versioning and storage location.
   - [ ] Establish next evolution of Attachment A to include all customer Xref parts and note which items Field is not stocking (no price, cold start lead time, no commitment).
   - [ ] Establish logic for ‚ÄúLead Time to Customer‚Äù column on the customer copy.
3. **Finalize Attachment A Process & Work Instructions**
   - [ ] Document each step for creating, updating, and sending the Attachment A.
   - [ ] Define ownership, create work instructions, and store alongside the master template.
4. **Pilot Rollout to Select Accounts**
   - [ ] Meet with sales reps to explain the new process and outline how the initial rollout will go.
   - [ ] Send Attachment A notification with clear messaging.
   - [ ] Capture reactions and adjust template or messaging.

   - [ ] Define ‚Äúslow-moving‚Äù criteria and create report layout in Power BI.

2. **Establish Accountability Process**
   - [ ] Define rule: if item is slow-moving for 2 periods, customer must issue a PO.
   - [ ] Document escalation and align with Sales Reps.
3. **Scheduling & Cadence**
   - [ ] Set quarterly/semi-annual process cadence.
   - [ ] Create meeting prep template.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection Log

<details>
<summary>üóìÔ∏è Oct 28, 2025 ‚Äî Reflection & Execution Score (80%)</summary>

> I am extremely proud of how well I conducted myself today. I didn't let much of anything distract me. I did the important work, even when I had to push myself to do it, and that felt great. I executed, and I stayed working on priorities. Although there was an unexpected reschedule that could have set me back on the Attachment A project, I decided to hunker down and build out the plan for the project that I've been putting off for so long. It feels great. I have direction. I'm ready to keep making forward momentum. I have no doubt I'll be able to take care of Nick's PA tomorrow, and that will feel great. This week's Big Three will be done with time to spare. It'll be the first time I'll be able to show that I am improving and becoming intentional.

**Execution Score:** 12 / 15 ‚Üí 80%
**Completed:** 3 of 5 planned tasks  
**Ad-hoc Wins:** 2 (tickets + contacts)
