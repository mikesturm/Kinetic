# Attachment A Update

## Tweaking the Sheet

1. Zach now pulled in the Smartsheet with old LTs
2. Hesitation on creating a new LT Field--even if it's non-audit trail.
3. Add a disclarimer about qtys being subject to change being MOQs
4. Add a disclaimer about how these qtys do not include previously identified commitments on specific items

## Initial Rollout Process

1. Tracker is built, top 50 are selected

2. Select small groups of customers based on AMs

3. Decide if automation can work the initial rollout
   
   1. meet with Zach and Steph on workado

4. Need to do internal meetings
   
   - Meet with Jake & Melissa to solidify AMs part of the role
   - Meet with Sales reps  to tell them about the process.
   - Meet with Gregg & Pauli on the verbiage & format 

## Building the Process

1. Let's confirm if I have this right:
   1. Automation to produce report (Do I have to get with Stephanie?)
   2. Send to AMs & Sales to review the first few times, but it will always go out automatically after the first few times.

## FUture

    1. Pull in stockable check mark.

2. Change to start with ALL customer xref parts
3. Make it so that the AM gets 4 weeks to review the Att. A and object to it, or it automatically gets sent out.
4. Inventory report on a customer dashboard rather thant being sent out.
