# Project: Evaluating Boltwise for Last Piece

**Purpose**: To test whether and to what extent Boltwise can make the last piece inspection process more efficient and its resulting data more accurate.

**Status**: Active

---

**Project Plan**

## Get the LP Team Into Boltwise & Ready to Use

## Check in with team & gather feedback

## Evaluate Efficiency & Effectiveness of Boltwise vs. Current Process

- [ ] Test the SPX implementation (recent) in Boltwise and compare to the actual P21 Item IDs we cross-referenced for SPX recently
  
  - [ ] Get feedback from Karla on getting access for: Mike Schewe, Dan Cox, Jacob Potter, Leo Rivas
  
  ## Notes
  
  - Current process = LP team works directly in PFEP, then exports & sends them to Sourcing
  - Karla: Sourcing's process is that everything starts in Boltwise, then goes to Qstrat
  - Long-term goal is to have all Quoting in Boltwise to start with and always quote with it.
  - Karla will get the guys logins & training
