# Project: Margin Protection Template
# Status: Pending
# Created: 2025-11-02
# Owner: Mike Sturm
# Linked Goals: [#G - Financial Integrity / Margin Resilience]

### Overview
Develop a margin protection template that automatically flags items with cost increases beyond a defined percentage threshold, using historical sales and cost data as baseline reference.

---

### Intent
Establish a reliable early-warning system to identify margin erosion due to cost drift, supplier inconsistency, or purchase order variance.

---

### Scope (Initial Notes)
- Use past 12 months of real sales and costs to establish baseline averages.
- Set visual cues for all items with > X% cost increase.
- Ensure primary supplier consistency check.
- Capture both PO cost and landed lot cost changes for visibility.
- Determine start date after baseline dataset is verified.

---

### Next Step
Hold pending until bandwidth and data audit alignment. Candidate for activation in Q1 2026 or during tariff-driven cost realignment cycle.
