# 📦 Project: Attachment A Rollout

**Purpose:** To solidify explicit inventory coverage for items we're stocking by developing and sending the new *Attachment A* notification to our top customers that takes into account supplier LT, customer usage, and items stocked at suppliers.
**Inclusion Rule:** Any open or new item containing “Attachment A” automatically falls under this project.  
**Status:** Active

## Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Define Scope & Customer List

- [x] Create Attachment A rollout tracker listing all target customers and planned send dates. *(Source list pulled from Power BI.)*
- [x] Schedule meeting with Chris for week of 11/10 to review plan & progress

### Phase 2: Finalize and Refine Attachment A Content & Format

- [x] @Zach  will pull Karla's Cost Savings Smarsheet into Attachment A template.
- [ ] (Once Zach pulls in Smartsheet) Create logic to use "Cold Start LT" instead of published LT for supplier stocked parts.
- [ ] Confirm versioning and storage location. (Where will it be kept? Date reference is probably ok.)
- [ ] Establish logic for “Lead Time to Customer” column on the customer copy.
    *I recommend we use the placeholder "transit", but we need to be sensitive to what looks best to most customers*
- [ ] 
- [ ] Update their datasource to the report server (per Chad)

### Phase 3: Finalize Attachment A Process, ownership, & Work Instructions

- [ ] Document each step for creating, updating, and sending the Attachment A.
  -
- [ ] Define ownership, create work instructions, and store alongside the master template.(Mike, Jake, Melissa)

### Phase 4: Pilot Rollout to Select Accounts

- [ ] Meet with sales reps to explain the new process and outline how the initial rollout will go.
- [ ] Send Attachment A notification with clear messaging.
- [ ] Capture reactions and adjust template or messaging.

### Phase 5: Full Rollout to Top Customers

- [ ] Schedule communication cadence and track confirmations.

### Phase 6: Follow-up & Tracking Metrics

- [ ] Verify acknowledgment, record confirmations, summarize coverage, and note next steps.
- [ ] Establish next evolution of Attachment A to include all customer Xref parts and note which items Field is not stocking (no price, cold start lead time, no commitment).

## Notes

- Need Lead time integrity in P21 that pulls in through contract queries
  
  - Karla would love "Cold Start LT" for items in stocking programs.

- Karla Sent Zach the Supplier stocking Smartsheet

- P21 update process
  
  - Once a contract is agreed to with supplier STOCKING is checked in P21
  
  - Once we get confirmation from supplier that they're ready to ship, the PUBLISHED LT is updated

- Further benefit of "Cold Start LT": BBI & Lindstrom, etc. parts would benefit
