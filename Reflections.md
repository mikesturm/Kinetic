### Daily Scores & Reflections ‚Äî 2025-10-30


Score: 16 / 28 (57%)
Highlights:
- Completed major administrative and financial work (tariffs, forecasts, and quarterly taxes).
- Created new project: Tariff Round 2 Increase.
- Added tomorrow's planning task: Review Bryce & Kyle forecasts.
- Streamlined the Kinetic system for next-level use.

Reflection:
The day started off kind of difficult - I hit snooze enough times to not wake up until 6:30, which left only ten minutes to make coffee and get the kids moving. Still, I managed to get my ass in gear, leave on time, and hit every key checkpoint. I streamlined the Kinetic system extremely well and now have a strong foundation for more productive days ahead. I got the important things done on time and feel genuinely satisfied with that. Looking forward to building on this momentum tomorrow.
