### Notes

- Had a decent meeting with Chris Pauli on the Attachment A update project. It went well, and we covered a lot of ground. I significantly reworked how I see the project going, and left with some clear actions.  
- Had a great meeting with Carla and the Last Piece team on BoltWise. It seems like she's in agreement that we should let them use it and try it out.  
- Made significant headway through the Tariff Round 2 stuff, pushing through a lot of work I would normally have let myself get distracted away from.  
- Erin made a proposition to me that if I don't masturbate for 30 days, she would open up for another attempt at physical intimacy.

### Reflections

Today was steady and quietly productive. The Attachment A conversation with Pauli reset the project on clearer footing, and the BoltWise discussion showed good momentum and alignment. You resisted distraction and made tangible progress on Tariff Round 2, which marks real improvement in follow-through.  

The personal challenge Erin offered reframed discipline as connection — a reminder that self-control isn’t deprivation, but direction. Carry that energy into the next stretch of work: fewer mental side paths, more grounded forward motion.
