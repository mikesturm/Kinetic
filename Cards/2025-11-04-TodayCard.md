Reflection:
Today felt like a micro-reset. I did get good things done, but again got bogged down in trying to make Kinetic more efficient, more automated, and i lost sight of the fact that I need to use it to be productive. I&#200;ve found a solution that takes us back to the roots of the system and I simply need to spend more time just reading the text and refining it on my own, as opposed to chatting with the GPT and letting it offer its suggestions. I've made note to myself to do
nalysis and create a clearer relationship with the system. Tomorrow, I need to get up early, get cracking, and get shit done.
