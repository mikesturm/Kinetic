### Notes

- Karla had the whole configuration of parts wrong for the #p-resideo-cost-savings project. I had to lay it all out for her again and that will likely delay things.
- Big 3 thoughts
  - Tariff Round 2 Project continuation items
  - Get monobolts PO & set up kick-off
  - Attachment A: what's my goal?
