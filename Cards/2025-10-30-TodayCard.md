## Notes from the day

* Had a great impromptu talk with Pauli about Attachment A project.

  * We agreed to a default 6 month cadence for sending out Attachment A updates.
  * I committed to sending him my project plan so far this week (this is the same as my current Big 3 task of a progress update)
  * I also committed to setting a meeting with him week after next (since he's traveling next week)
