### Notes

- The kids had their CYT showcase, which was decent. It was @Miles's first one. 
  
  - We went to Buona beef afterward and had a good dinner & desert.

- Had a great talk with @Norah after she had trouble sleeping because she didn't think she did well at her Matilda callback audition, and wanted to ask to retry. I told her how to talk to God, and told her that sometimes disappointment is part of God's plan to help you be the best person you can be. It felt great and I think it really helped her.

### Reflections

I did okay today, but failed to report on last week's big 3 to Gregg or to create my new big 3. But I worked with fewer distractions--which was good.
