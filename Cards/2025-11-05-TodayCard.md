### Notes

* Meeting with @Adam on Monobolts deal went decent. He said he's okay with me getting the business at what I showed him, but wants us to really push to chop those rebates down thru eng. cost savings and slow-moving \& OBS if applicable.
* Meeting on Tariff Round 2 Increases project went Ok
