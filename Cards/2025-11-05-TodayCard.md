### Notes

- Meeting with @Adam on MonoBolt went decent. He said he's okay with me getting the business at what I showed him, but wants us to really push to chop those rebates down thru end. cost savings and slow-moving & OBS if applicable.
- Meeting on Tariff Round 2 Increases project went Ok

### Reflections

The day was decent. I worked on high-value projects and avoided getting sucked into lower-value things. I would have liked to have gotten the couple of somewhat easy commitments to Bryce met, but since there was no hard time frame, I'm okay with just getting those done quickly tomorrow and getting back to him. I know I need to work on getting Josh Lukasak that information that I committed to getting for Honeywell, but it became clear to me today that I should have done a lot more to think about this Tariff Round 2 project. I saw Greg's frustration kinda growing with the state of things and the little amount of data that the team had provided. I feel like that's something I should have gotten moving on a while ago. I just wasn't really clear on how to do it, and I guess just got wrapped us in other things. At the end of the day, though, I was able to leave with Ali and Casey and have a really awesome time going to the Head Automatica show with those guys. We ate at a Cuban restaurant that I picked just off the cuff on the way there, and it was excellent. I just had a lot of fun joking around with those guys. We have a lot in common, and I look forward to developing further relationships with them.
