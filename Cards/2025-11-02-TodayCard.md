> I feel like I did okay today. The one thing I did wrong was letting myself get too distracted by image editing stuff that keeps cropping up. I could’ve gotten these other two items done if I d'e spent that time that I spent on image editing doing these two items, but I still did a decent amount to shore up my system and get my inbox under control. I need to do better, and I will. I'm getting there.
