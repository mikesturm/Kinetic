# SAP Refinement (Brad Derry)

**Due:** 2025-11-14  
**Phase:** Messaging + System Flow Design  

## Objective  
Refine SAP usage philosophy and supporting processes to shift focus away from procedural rigidity and toward strategic, goal-driven team behavior.

## Next Steps  
1. **Deliver SAP Refinement Message**
    Book time during the next Sales Huddle to deliver this message:   
   > "Forget the SAP documents. They're tools, use them if you want to.  
   > Focus o n **Strategy, Goals, Actions, and Stakeholders** , and make sure THE  THOLE TEAM is treating the customer as if this is your branch and this is one of your biggest customers."  

 2. **Build Flow Chart**
   Create a simple yes/no flow chart for sales reps to follow. This chart should help:  
   - Pass work efficiently to the right team member.  
   - Drive results to deadlines.  
   - Prevent items from slipping through cracks.  

## Status  
Active â€” next steps scheduled before due date (2025-11-14).  

## Notes  
- Brad Derry to review alignment after first presentation.  
- Opportunity to use this as a model for wider SalesOps behavioral refinement initiative.
