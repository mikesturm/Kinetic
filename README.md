# Kinetic 2.0 Skeleton

This repo contains the file structure and scripts for the Kinetic 2.0 system.

- `ledger/ledger.csv` – single source of truth for all objects.
- `surfaces/Inbox.md` – capture surface (one line per object).
- `surfaces/S3.md` – time-horizon scheduling board.
- `views/*.md` – auto-generated dynamic views.
- `daily/` – Today cards (you create these manually).
- `scripts/` – Python scripts that keep everything in sync.
- `archive/` – Completed items, deleted objects, and old views.
