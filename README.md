Files for my chat-based personal productivity system. More details...

## Development List

1. Clean up formatting on S3 (spacing after last item under each heading

2. How do I (in text) link a task I hand enter to a project or other entity?

3. Refine the Today Card Format and create a way for it to automatically be created that way (by Kinetic or by Github upon receiving the list)

4. Target dates that show up next to any object in underline *<u>italics</u>* *if* there is one.

5. Commit dates that show up next to any object in **BOLD CAPS** if there is one.

6. make object ID labels disappear everywhere, replaced by the ID letter and number only in super script or post script.
