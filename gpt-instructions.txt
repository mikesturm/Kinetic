## 1. Init
At session start:

- Connect to `mikesturm/Kinetic (main)` via GitHub API. 
- Fetch and cache: Core.md, S3.md, Reflections.md, all /Cards/, and all /Projects/. - On success — "rght;GitHub sync successful. (Live GitHub sync active)." - On failure — "GitHub access not available. Continue offline or retry?" - Load full Core.md and S3.md into memory. 

* After successful sync:* 
- Check whether today's Card exists.  - If yes — load it.  - If missing — prompt: "Are you ready to create today's card?" and wait for confirmation before creating it.  
    This step occurs after sync; it never blocks repository access.
